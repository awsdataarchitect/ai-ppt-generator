# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for fixing critical system issues identified in the AI PPT Generator application. The fixes address data consistency problems, incomplete implementations, error handling gaps, and operational documentation deficiencies that impact production stability and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Subscription Cancellation Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want subscription cancellation to work consistently across all API endpoints, so that user billing states remain accurate and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subscription is cancelled through any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL use atomic update operations to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN a subscription is cancelled THEN the system SHALL set both `status` to 'CANCELLED' and `cancelledAt` timestamp consistently
3. WHEN a subscription is cancelled THEN the system SHALL update Cognito user attributes to reflect the cancellation
4. WHEN a subscription cancellation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all partial changes and return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN subscription cancellation succeeds THEN both API endpoints SHALL return consistent response formats

### Requirement 2: Multi-Format File Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload various document formats (PDF, DOC, TXT), so that I can create presentations from any of my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a file for upload THEN the system SHALL validate the file type against supported formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
2. WHEN a file is converted to base64 THEN the system SHALL handle the appropriate MIME type prefix for each format
3. WHEN an unsupported file type is selected THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message listing supported formats
4. WHEN file processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages based on the failure type
5. WHEN file size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL display formatted file size and maximum allowed size

### Requirement 3: Complete Redis RAG Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Redis vector search implementation to be complete and robust, so that document semantic search works reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a semantic search query is executed THEN the system SHALL complete the full Redis vector search implementation
2. WHEN embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide fallback responses
3. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN vector search returns no results THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user feedback
5. WHEN search operations timeout THEN the system SHALL return partial results if available

### Requirement 4: Standardized Timeout Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want timeout values to be consistent and configurable, so that I can optimize system performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN timeout values SHALL be loaded from environment variables with documented defaults
2. WHEN document processing exceeds timeout THEN the system SHALL save partial progress and notify the user
3. WHEN Lambda functions approach timeout THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies
4. WHEN timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. WHEN timeout configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply new values without requiring code deployment

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Input Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle invalid inputs gracefully, so that the application remains stable and provides helpful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN numeric input is expected THEN the system SHALL validate for positive numbers and handle edge cases
2. WHEN file size formatting is requested THEN the system SHALL handle null, undefined, and negative values safely
3. WHEN invalid input is detected THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent further processing and maintain application stability
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debugging information

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to recover gracefully from errors, so that I can continue using the application without losing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system component fails THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide contextual error messages to users
3. WHEN partial operations complete THEN the system SHALL save progress and allow continuation
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail safely without corrupting data
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL allow users to resume their workflow

### Requirement 7: Production Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can proactively address issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components start THEN health check endpoints SHALL be available for monitoring
2. WHEN performance metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate alerts
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications to operators
4. WHEN system degradation is detected THEN automated rollback procedures SHALL be available
5. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN it SHALL be structured for easy analysis and trending

### Requirement 8: Operational Documentation and Procedures

**User Story:** As a developer or operator, I want clear documentation of system issues and solutions, so that I can quickly resolve problems and prevent recurrence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system issues are identified THEN root cause analysis SHALL be documented with technical details
2. WHEN solutions are implemented THEN step-by-step procedures SHALL be documented for future reference
3. WHEN rollback is needed THEN detailed rollback procedures SHALL be available and tested
4. WHEN new issues arise THEN troubleshooting guides SHALL provide systematic approaches
5. WHEN system changes are made THEN documentation SHALL be updated to reflect current state
