## 🔧 Configuration Files

Pre-configured assessment profiles are available:

### security-assessment.config.json
Complete comprehensive assessment covering all security domains:
- Infrastructure security (AWS CDK configurations)
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Data flow and privacy analysis
- Application security patterns

### quick-scan.config.json
Fast security scan focusing on critical vulnerabilities:
- High-priority security issues

## 📊 Security Scanners

The tool includes specialized scanners for different security domains:

### Infrastructure Security Scanner
- **Purpose**: AWS CDK configuration security analysis
- **Coverage**: S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, IAM, Cognito, API Gateway
- **Focus**: Misconfigurations, overprivileged access, missing encryption

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanner
- **Purpose**: Third-party library security assessment
- **Coverage**: npm packages, license compliance, known vulnerabilities
- **Focus**: Outdated packages, security advisories, license risks

### Data Flow Security Scanner
- **Purpose**: Privacy and data protection analysis
- **Coverage**: PII detection, GDPR compliance, data handling
- **Focus**: Personal data exposure, regulatory compliance

## 📈 Understanding Reports

### Report Structure

Each assessment generates multiple report types:

1. **Comprehensive Report**: Complete security analysis with all findings
2. **Executive Summary**: Business-focused summary for leadership
3. **Technical Appendix**: Detailed vulnerability analysis with PoCs
4. **Compliance Analysis**: Framework-specific compliance assessment

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

- 🔴 **Critical (9.0-10.0 CVSS)**: Immediate business threat
- 🟠 **High (7.0-8.9 CVSS)**: Significant security risk
- 🟡 **Medium (4.0-6.9 CVSS)**: Moderate security concern
- 🟢 **Low (0.1-3.9 CVSS)**: Minor security issue

### Risk Assessment

Reports include business impact analysis:
- Financial impact estimates
- Recovery time objectives
- Compliance violation risks
- Reputation damage assessment

└── security-reports/       # Generated assessment reports
```

### Adding Custom Scanners

1. Implement the `ScannerInterface`:
```typescript
export interface ScannerInterface {
  configure(config: any): Promise<void>;
  scan(targetPath: string): Promise<SecurityFinding[]>;
  generateReport(findings: SecurityFinding[]): Promise<string>;
}
```

2. Register the scanner in the orchestrator
3. Add configuration options
4. Update documentation

### Extending Compliance Frameworks

1. Create a new mapper in `src/mappers/`
2. Implement the compliance mapping logic
3. Add to the report generation pipeline
4. Update configuration files

## 🔒 Security Considerations

This tool performs READ-ONLY analysis and does not modify any code or configurations. It:

- ✅ Analyzes code patterns and configurations
- ✅ Generates security reports and recommendations
- ✅ Maps findings to compliance frameworks
- ❌ Does not execute or modify any code
- ❌ Does not access external systems or APIs
- ❌ Does not store sensitive information

## 📞 Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Scanner Timeout:**
```bash
# Increase timeout in configuration
{
  "timeout": 600,  // 10 minutes
  "maxConcurrent": 1
}
```

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Run with increased memory
node --max-old-space-size=4096 dist/cli/SecurityAssessmentCLI.js
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
node dist/cli/SecurityAssessmentCLI.js \
  --debug \
  --log-file ./debug.log \
  --verbose
```
