# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for migrating the AI PPT Generator from Redis-based RAG to AWS-native solutions using S3 vectors and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. This migration will eliminate external dependencies, improve scalability, reduce operational complexity, and create a professional-grade application while addressing existing system issues. The migration SHALL maximize reuse of existing functionality, refactoring rather than rebuilding components wherever possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the application THEN the UI SHALL provide consistent visual feedback and loading states, enhancing existing interface components
2. WHEN file uploads occur THEN users SHALL see real-time progress indicators and status updates, building on existing upload functionality
3. WHEN errors occur THEN users SHALL receive clear, actionable error messages with recovery options, improving existing error handling
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display a professional dashboard with organized sections, refining the current dashboard layout
5. WHEN users navigate the application THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and accessible, optimizing existing navigation patterns

### Requirement 3: Bedrock Knowledge Base Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for document processing and retrieval, so that the system leverages AWS-managed vector search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Knowledge Base is created THEN it SHALL be configured with appropriate embedding models and S3 data sources, replacing existing Redis vector store initialization
2. WHEN documents are ingested THEN they SHALL be automatically processed and indexed by the Knowledge Base, adapting existing document processing pipelines
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL use the Knowledge Base RetrieveAndGenerate API for context-aware responses, maintaining existing query interfaces
4. WHEN Knowledge Base operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry and fallback mechanisms, extending existing error handling patterns
5. WHEN Knowledge Base sync occurs THEN the system SHALL track ingestion status and provide user feedback, reusing existing status tracking mechanisms

### Requirement 4: S3-Based Document Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my documents to be securely stored and efficiently processed in S3, so that I have reliable access to my content for presentation generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in S3 with proper encryption and access controls
2. WHEN document metadata is needed THEN it SHALL be stored alongside the document with consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN documents are processed THEN they SHALL be chunked and prepared for Knowledge Base ingestion
4. WHEN document access is required THEN it SHALL use presigned URLs for secure, time-limited access
5. WHEN documents are deleted THEN they SHALL be removed from both S3 and the Knowledge Base index

### Requirement 5: Legacy Issue Resolution

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want all existing system issues to be resolved during the migration, so that the new architecture is stable and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscription cancellation occurs THEN it SHALL use consistent atomic operations across all endpoints
2. WHEN file processing happens THEN it SHALL support multiple formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) with proper validation
3. WHEN timeout scenarios occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
4. WHEN input validation is performed THEN it SHALL handle edge cases and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately and provide recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Infrastructure as Code Updates

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the CDK infrastructure to be updated for AWS-native services, so that the deployment is automated and follows AWS best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN it SHALL include Bedrock Knowledge Base resources with proper IAM permissions
2. WHEN S3 buckets are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate lifecycle policies and security configurations
3. WHEN Lambda functions are deployed THEN they SHALL have the necessary permissions for Bedrock and S3 operations
4. WHEN the stack is updated THEN it SHALL remove all Redis-related resources and dependencies
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL follow CDK best practices with proper construct organization

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large documents and concurrent users efficiently, so that I can rely on the application for production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large documents are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without timeout issues
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL scale automatically using AWS-managed services
3. WHEN Knowledge Base queries are executed THEN they SHALL return results within acceptable time limits
4. WHEN system load increases THEN AWS services SHALL auto-scale to maintain performance
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be monitored and used for optimization

### Requirement 8: Security and Compliance Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the system to follow AWS security best practices, so that user data and system operations are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest and in transit using AWS KMS
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use proper IAM roles and least-privilege access
3. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN it SHALL integrate securely with AWS Cognito
4. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN they SHALL be logged and auditable
5. WHEN data access is required THEN it SHALL use time-limited, scoped permissions

### Requirement 10: S3 Vectors Implementation Specifics

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement S3 Vectors correctly with Bedrock Knowledge Base, so that the system achieves cost optimization while maintaining functionality and avoiding common implementation pitfalls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector index is created THEN it SHALL use correct dimensions (1024 for Titan Text v2, not 1536) to ensure compatibility
2. WHEN Knowledge Base is configured THEN it SHALL use full indexArn format instead of indexName to meet AWS API requirements
3. WHEN Data Source is created THEN it SHALL explicitly include 'type': 'S3' parameter to pass validation
4. WHEN IAM permissions are configured THEN they SHALL include all required S3 vectors permissions including s3vectors:GetIndex
5. WHEN resources are created THEN they SHALL follow proper sequence with wait times to ensure resource readiness

### Requirement 11: Production Monitoring and Operational Excellence
