# Security Vulnerability Assessment Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive security vulnerability assessment system for the AI PPT Generator codebase. The system will analyze the entire project for security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and deployment risks without modifying any existing code. The assessment will generate detailed markdown reports with remediation plans following industry standards including OWASP, NIST, and security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Security Analysis

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to analyze the React/Next.js frontend for client-side vulnerabilities, so that user data and authentication flows are protected from XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN frontend code is scanned THEN it SHALL identify potential XSS vulnerabilities in React components
2. WHEN authentication flows are analyzed THEN it SHALL assess Amplify v6 integration security
3. WHEN file upload mechanisms are evaluated THEN it SHALL check for client-side validation bypasses
4. WHEN third-party dependencies are scanned THEN it SHALL identify known vulnerabilities in npm packages
5. WHEN webpack configuration is reviewed THEN it SHALL assess bundle security and exposure risks
6. WHEN environment variable usage is analyzed THEN it SHALL identify potential secret exposure

### Requirement 2: Backend Lambda Security Assessment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to evaluate Lambda function security for injection vulnerabilities and privilege escalation risks, so that the serverless backend is protected from malicious attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Lambda functions are analyzed THEN they SHALL be scanned for SQL injection patterns in DynamoDB queries
2. WHEN file processing logic is evaluated THEN it SHALL identify potential code injection in document processing
3. WHEN AWS service integrations are assessed THEN it SHALL verify IAM permission configurations
4. WHEN user input handling is reviewed THEN it SHALL identify insufficient input validation
5. WHEN error handling is analyzed THEN it SHALL check for information disclosure in error messages
6. WHEN Python dependencies are scanned THEN it SHALL identify known security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 3: Infrastructure Security Evaluation

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want to assess CDK infrastructure configurations for security misconfigurations and compliance violations, so that AWS resources are properly secured and follow best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN CDK stacks are analyzed THEN they SHALL be checked against AWS security best practices
2. WHEN IAM policies are evaluated THEN they SHALL be assessed for overprivileged access
3. WHEN S3 bucket configurations are reviewed THEN they SHALL be checked for public access risks
4. WHEN API Gateway settings are analyzed THEN they SHALL be evaluated for authentication bypasses
5. WHEN DynamoDB configurations are assessed THEN they SHALL be checked for encryption and access controls
6. WHEN Cognito settings are reviewed THEN they SHALL be evaluated for authentication security

### Requirement 4: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to scan all project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and license compliance issues, so that third-party risks are identified and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN npm dependencies are scanned THEN they SHALL be checked against CVE databases
2. WHEN Python requirements are analyzed THEN they SHALL be evaluated for security advisories
3. WHEN CDK dependencies are assessed THEN they SHALL be checked for infrastructure vulnerabilities
4. WHEN license compliance is evaluated THEN it SHALL identify potential legal risks
5. WHEN dependency versions are analyzed THEN it SHALL recommend security updates
6. WHEN transitive dependencies are scanned THEN they SHALL be included in vulnerability assessment

### Requirement 5: Data Flow Security Analysis

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to analyze data flows and storage patterns for privacy and security compliance, so that sensitive data handling meets regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user data flows are mapped THEN they SHALL identify PII handling patterns
2. WHEN document processing is analyzed THEN it SHALL assess content security and isolation
3. WHEN authentication tokens are tracked THEN they SHALL be evaluated for secure handling
4. WHEN API communications are reviewed THEN they SHALL be checked for encryption requirements
5. WHEN data storage patterns are assessed THEN they SHALL be evaluated for compliance with GDPR/CCPA
6. WHEN user isolation is analyzed THEN it SHALL verify proper multi-tenant security

### Requirement 6: Deployment Security Assessment

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to evaluate deployment configurations and CI/CD pipelines for security risks, so that production deployments are secure and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN deployment scripts are analyzed THEN they SHALL be checked for hardcoded secrets
2. WHEN environment configurations are reviewed THEN they SHALL be assessed for security misconfigurations
3. WHEN build processes are evaluated THEN they SHALL be checked for supply chain security
4. WHEN monitoring configurations are assessed THEN they SHALL be evaluated for security logging
5. WHEN backup and recovery processes are reviewed THEN they SHALL be checked for data protection
6. WHEN network configurations are analyzed THEN they SHALL be assessed for proper segmentation

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Security Report Generation

**User Story:** As a security team lead, I want detailed markdown reports with prioritized findings and remediation plans, so that security issues can be systematically addressed and tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN security assessment is complete THEN it SHALL generate a comprehensive markdown report
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are identified THEN they SHALL be categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. WHEN remediation plans are provided THEN they SHALL include specific implementation steps
4. WHEN compliance gaps are found THEN they SHALL be mapped to relevant standards (OWASP, NIST, SOC2)
5. WHEN risk assessments are generated THEN they SHALL include business impact analysis
6. WHEN security metrics are calculated THEN they SHALL provide overall security posture scoring

### Requirement 8: Industry Standards Compliance Mapping

**User Story:** As a compliance manager, I want security findings mapped to industry standards and frameworks, so that compliance requirements can be systematically addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OWASP Top 10 assessment is performed THEN it SHALL map findings to specific OWASP categories
2. WHEN NIST Cybersecurity Framework evaluation is conducted THEN it SHALL align findings with NIST controls
3. WHEN AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar is assessed THEN it SHALL evaluate against AWS security best practices
4. WHEN SOC2 Type II readiness is evaluated THEN it SHALL identify gaps in security controls
5. WHEN ISO 27001 compliance is assessed THEN it SHALL map findings to relevant ISO controls
6. WHEN regulatory compliance is evaluated THEN it SHALL consider GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA requirements
